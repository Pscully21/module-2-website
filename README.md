# module-2-website

  During this challenge we had to build a website for our future projects to be hosted on. This website will eventually be used by possible employers to look at the work we have done individually and the projects we have worked on in groups. It also gave us a look into what to expect if we do eventually end up getting a job in the web development field. Building and perfecting websites will be a number one priority for employers and this was our first time writing a website from scratch. This was a harder assignment in my opinion but I do think it was intented to stretch the brain a little bit. I've realized I'm stronger in certain areas of coding in comparison to others, it's all about reacting to certain situations and problems and how you go about fixing them.
