        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is Parker Scully. I am currently enrolled in Arizona Universities full-stack Web Development program. Outside of the classroom I like to parttake in lots of outside activities. I live a very active life by going to the gym every day (I try), playing soccer and football with friends, and hiking the hundreds of mountains we have here in upstate New York. I have my Associates degree in Environmental Science and am looking forward to gaining my certificate after I accomplish what needs to be done within the bootcamp.</p>
